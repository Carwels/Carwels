# PROJECTS

I am a graduate in Web Development from Ironhack Barcelona. Having previously studied tourism, I transitioned to web development, and since then, I have engaged in various projects involving Next.js, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, SCSS, and CSS. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Informatics at Universitat Carlemany.
